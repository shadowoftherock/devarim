# Divine forgiveness, restoration, and the new covenant of HaShem

## The Context of Judgment and Hope

Both Jeremiah and Ezekiel prophesied during the Babylonian exile, when Israel faced the consequences of breaking their covenant with HaShem. Yet within their messages of judgment, they proclaimed extraordinary promises of forgiveness and renewal.

## The New Covenant Promise

**Jeremiah 31:31-34** contains one of the most revolutionary passages in the Hebrew Bible:

HaShem promises to make a "new covenant" with Israel—not like the one their ancestors broke. This covenant would be different: HaShem would write His law directly on their hearts rather than on stone tablets. He declares, "I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more."

**Jeremiah 32:40** speaks of an "everlasting covenant" where HaShem promises: "I will never stop doing good to them, and I will inspire them to fear me, so that they will never turn away from me."

This represents a fundamental shift. HaShem taking responsibility for ensuring the covenant's success by transforming human hearts from within.

## HaShem's Forgiveness in Jeremiah

Several passages illuminate HaShem's forgiving nature:

- **Jeremiah 3:12-14**: Despite Israel's spiritual adultery, HaShem invites them to return, saying "I am faithful" and "I will not be angry forever"

- **Jeremiah 33:8**: "I will cleanse them from all the sin they have committed against me and will forgive all their sins of rebellion"

- **Jeremiah 31:20**: HaShem speaks of Ephraim as "my dear son," whose memory moves Him to compassion

The forgiveness isn't cheap—it comes after judgment—but it's complete and transformative.

## Ezekiel's Vision of Renewal

Ezekiel adds powerful imagery to this promise:

**Ezekiel 36:25-27**: HaShem promises to:
- Sprinkle clean water on them for purification
- Give them a new heart and a new spirit
- Remove their "heart of stone" and give them a "heart of flesh"
- Put His Spirit within them to enable obedience

**Ezekiel 37:1-14** (Valley of Dry Bones): This vision dramatizes resurrection from spiritual death. HaShem breathing life into what seemed beyond hope.

**Ezekiel 11:19-20** and **34:25-31**: HaShem promises to gather the scattered people, give them one heart, and establish a "covenant of peace."

## The Nature of This Divine Forgiveness

What makes this forgiveness remarkable:

1. **It's unilateral**: HaShem initiates and enables it, not dependent on human capacity to change themselves

2. **It's transformative**: Not just pardoning sin but changing the inner nature that produces sin

3. **It's permanent**: An "everlasting covenant" that HaShem commits to maintaining

4. **It's comprehensive**: Covering all sins, with HaShem choosing not to remember them

5. **It's restorative**: Bringing Israel back to their land and relationship with HaShem
