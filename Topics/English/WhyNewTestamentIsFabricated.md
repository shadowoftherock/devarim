The New Testament is not reliable in proving that the events it describes actually happened. 
Looking at early Christian history, we see that it started under Roman influence, especially under Emperor Constantine I. Constantine pushed and reshaped Christianity.

When the earliest known manuscript, the Codex Sinaiticus (dated A.D. 330–360), was discovered, the original New Testament writings were already lost and could no longer be recovered. 
It is possible to argue that the New Testament could have been fabricated by the Romans.


To prove that, lets see the prophesy of Daniel in Daniel 7. 

In **Daniel 7**, the prophet Daniel sees **four beasts** coming out of the sea. These beasts symbolize **four kingdoms or empires**. Here is the description and the standard historical interpretation (used by Jews, Christians, and many scholars):

---

# **1. First Beast — Lion with Eagle’s Wings**

**Daniel 7:4**

**Description:**

* A **lion**
* Has **eagle’s wings**
* Wings are plucked
* Stands like a man
* Given a human mind/heart

**Interpretation:**
Most scholars identify it with **Babylon**.

* The lion was a Babylonian symbol.
* Nebuchadnezzar’s humbling and restoration (Daniel 4) matches the imagery of being “made human.”

---

# **2. Second Beast — Bear Raised on One Side**

**Daniel 7:5**

**Description:**

* A **bear**
* Raised up on **one side**
* Has **three ribs** in its mouth
* Told to “devour much flesh”

**Interpretation:**
Usually interpreted as the **Medo-Persian Empire**.

* “Raised on one side” = Persian side stronger than Medes
* Three ribs = three major conquests (Babylon, Lydia, Egypt)

---

# **3. Third Beast — Leopard with Four Wings and Four Heads**

**Daniel 7:6**

**Description:**

* A **leopard**
* Has **four wings**
* Has **four heads**
* Given authority to rule

**Interpretation:**
Commonly interpreted as **Greece under Alexander the Great**.

* Leopard = speed
* Four wings = rapid conquest
* Four heads = division of the empire into **four kingdoms** after Alexander (the Diadochi)

---

# **4. Fourth Beast — Terrifying Monster**

**Daniel 7:7**

**Description:**

* Unlike any known animal
* Terrifying, exceedingly strong
* Iron teeth
* Devouring and trampling everything
* Has **ten horns**

**Interpretation:**
Traditionally understood as **Rome**.

* Iron = strength (similar to Daniel 2)
* Ten horns = later rulers or divisions of the empire

Some interpretations (especially in prophetic or apocalyptic circles) see the fourth beast as:

* **Rome (historical)**
  or
* A **future empire** symbolized by Rome

Both interpretations exist in Christian traditions.

| ------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Lion with wings                | Babylon     | Babylonian Empire        |
| Bear raised on one side        | Medo-Persia | Persian dominance        |
| Leopard with 4 wings & heads   | Greece      | Alexander → 4 kingdoms   |
| Terrifying beast with 10 horns | Rome        | Roman Empire (or future) |

Daniel 7:25 is part of the vision describing an entity who arises from the fourth beast’s kingdom. Here is the verse and its meaning.

### Daniel 7:25 (KJV)

“And he shall speak great words against the most High,
and shall wear out the saints of the most High,
and think to change times and laws:
and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.”

To better understand the prophesy, lets look at the "think to change times". What is the fulfillment of this?

It was fulfilled under Roman rule when they introduced the **Julian calendar** in **45 B.C.**, created under **Julius Caesar** with the help of the Alexandrian astronomer **Sosigenes**. This calendar reorganized the structure of the year, fixed the length of months, and standardized the leap-year system—an example of Rome “changing times and laws.”

Later, this system was further modified when the West transitioned to the **Gregorian calendar** in **A.D. 1582**, under **Pope Gregory XIII**, to correct inaccuracies in the Julian calculation of the solar year. The Gregorian reform adjusted the leap-year rule and skipped 10 days from the calendar, completing the major transformation of the calendar system inherited from Rome.

So we see that the prophecy, *“think to change times,”* aligns well with the actions of the Roman Empire. Now let us examine the second part of the prophecy: *“think to change laws.”* To identify what law was changed, we must first determine which law Daniel is referring to.

Consider this passage:

**Malachi 4:4**
*“Remember the law of Moses My servant, which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel…”*

Is this the law that Daniel is talking about? Yes. Daniel is referring to **the law given to Moses at Horeb**, the foundational commandments. When the prophecy speaks of a power that will “think to change laws,” it points to **altering or replace the law of Moses**

What law replaces the law of Moses? It was altered and replaced by the law of Christ. It was Constantine I, who began promoting and favoring Christianity starting in A.D. 312–313. The same Roman empire that was prophesized that will **"think to change times and laws"**.

On this premis, we have a match for the prophesy that Rome will **"think to change times and laws"**.

### Footnote:
There is no direct evidence that the New Testament was fabricated by the Roman Empire, especially since it has to be done in secret. However, I personally believe it have been organized by Julius Cesar in Rome, given its political expertise. I also believe that the discovery of early New Testament manuscripts have been orchestrated to provide a foundation for establishing the Roman Catholic Church.
