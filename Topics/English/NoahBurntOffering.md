Good question—this comes up often when people compare **Noah** himself with **later Noahides**.

### 1. Did Noah offer burnt offerings?

**Yes.**
After the Flood, the Torah says:

> *“Then Noah built an altar unto Hashem and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.”*
> — **Genesis 8:20**

So Noah personally **did offer burnt offerings**, and HaShem accepted them.

---

### 2. Why can’t Noahides today offer burnt offerings?

The key point is **timing and divine permission**.

#### a. Noah lived **before** later restrictions

* Noah lived **before the Torah was given at Sinai**
* At that time, **any human** could build an altar and offer sacrifices if HaShem accepted them
* There was **no central sanctuary** and no priesthood yet

Examples:

* Abel offered sacrifices
* Noah offered sacrifices
* Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob offered sacrifices

All of this was allowed **before Sinai**

---

#### b. After Sinai, sacrifices became restricted

Once HaShem gave the Torah to Israel:

* Sacrifices were **centralized**
* Offerings could only be brought:

  * In the **chosen place** (eventually the Temple in Jerusalem)
  * By **authorized priests (Kohanim)**
* Offering sacrifices outside this system became forbidden

> Even Jews today **cannot** offer animal sacrifices because the Temple no longer stands.

---

### 3. Noahides are not commanded to bring offerings

The **Seven Noahide Laws**:

* Do **not** include sacrifices
* Are about basic moral and spiritual obligations for humanity

From the Jewish legal perspective:

* A Noahide offering animal sacrifices today would be acting **without divine authorization**
* Worship through unauthorized rituals is considered improper, even if intentions are good

This is similar to how:

* A Jew offering sacrifices today would also be doing something forbidden

---

### 4. How can Noahides worship HaShem today?

According to traditional Jewish teaching, Noahides serve HaShem through:

* **Prayer**
* **Charity**
* **Justice and moral living**
* **Acknowledging one Elohim**
* **Observing the Seven Laws**

The prophet Hosea expresses this idea well:

> *“We will offer the bulls of our lips.”* (Hosea 14:3)
> Meaning: **prayer replaces sacrifices** when sacrifices are not permitted.

---

### Summary

* ✅ **Noah did offer burnt offerings**
* ⏳ This was **before** later restrictions
* 🚫 Noahides today are **not permitted** to offer animal sacrifices
* 🙏 Worship today is through **ethical living, prayer, and devotion**, not offerings

## The Talmud does address this:
The conclusion drawn by the sages is that **Noahides today are not permitted to offer sacrifices on their own**, even though Noah himself did.

Below are the **key Talmudic sources** and how they are understood.

---

## 1. Sacrifices were once permitted to all humanity

The Talmud explicitly states that **before the Torah was given**, sacrifices were allowed for everyone.

### **Zevachim 116b**

> *“Before the Torah was given, private altars (bamot) were permitted, and the service was performed by the firstborn.”*

This explains:

* Why **Noah**, **Abraham**, **Isaac**, and **Jacob** could offer sacrifices
* Why Noah’s burnt offering in Genesis 8 was valid

---

## 2. After Sinai, sacrifices became restricted

Once the Torah was given:

* Sacrifices were limited to **Israel**
* They could only be brought in the **chosen place**
* And only through **authorized priests**

### **Zevachim 112b–113a**

> *“Once the Tabernacle was erected, private altars were forbidden.”*

This applies **universally**, not just to Jews.

---

## 3. What about Noahides specifically?

The Talmud discusses Noahides (Gentiles) and sacrifices directly.

### **Avodah Zarah 64b**

* A Noahide is permitted to bring an offering **only if** it is done **within the authorized Temple system**
* Outside that framework, it is not permitted

Since:

* The Temple no longer exists
* No sacrifices are authorized at all today

➡️ **Noahides may not offer sacrifices now**, just like Jews may not.

---

## 4. Noahides are not commanded to offer sacrifices

### **Sanhedrin 56a–b**

The Talmud lists the **Seven Noahide Laws**
**Sacrifices are not included**.

From a halakhic perspective:

* Performing religious rituals **not commanded by HaShem** can be considered improper worship
* This is sometimes classified under serving HaShem in an **unauthorized manner**

---

## 5. How later Jewish law summarizes this

Maimonides (based on the Talmud):

### **Mishneh Torah, Kings 10:10**

* A Noahide should serve HaShem **according to what HaShem commanded for Noahides**
* Not invent new ritual obligations

---

## Clear conclusion

* ✅ The Talmud **acknowledges Noah’s sacrifice**
* ⏳ It explains that this was **before Sinai**
* 🚫 After Sinai, **sacrifices are restricted**
* ❌ **Noahides today may not offer sacrifices**
* 🙏 Their service to HaShem is through **the Seven Laws, prayer, justice, and morality**
