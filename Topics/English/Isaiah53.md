Let us carefully examine Isaiah 53 to determine whether the chapter truly refers to Jesus, as Christians claim, or whether it more accurately applies to Israel.

In Isaiah 53:2 we have a plant that is out of a dry ground, lest read it:

> Isaiah 53:2 - For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.


If Jesus is likened to a plant, He would be one planted beside a stream, just as Scripture describes a blessed man. Lets look at the verses:


1. Psalm 1:3

> “He is like a tree planted by streams of water,
that yields its fruit in its season,
and its leaf does not wither.
In all that he does, he prospers.”

This verse is often paraphrased as “a tree planted beside the river” or “by the waters.”

2. Jeremiah 17:7–8

> “Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD,
whose trust is the LORD.
He is like a tree planted by water,
that sends out its roots by the stream,

But Isaiah 53:2 says thee plant is out of a dry ground and no blessing of waters. This couldn't be the messiah because the messiah will have a bleessing of water.









### In Isaiah 53:4,

> “Surely he has borne our sicknesses and carried our pains, yet we considered him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.”

Isaiah 53:4 portrays **Israel**, God’s servant, bearing suffering that the nations wrongly interpreted as divine punishment. 

Smitten” is used metaphorically, just as in the earlier passage where he is likened to a plant.

In Hebrew prophetic language, “sickness,” “pain,” and “wounds” often refer to:

* Exile
* Oppression like the Holocaust (genocide of European Jews during World War II. From 1941 to 1945, Nazi Germany )

Israel bore the weight of persecution, displacement, and violence caused by the nations.

### Collective language fits Israel

Although the servant is sometimes described in the singular, this is normal for Israel:

* Israel is often spoken of as a single “servant,” “son,” or “vine”
* Example: *“Israel is a scattered sheep”* (Jeremiah 50:17)

### Summary
Isaiah 53:4 portrays **Israel**

## In Isaiah 53:7,
>  Isaiah 53:7 - He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.

This lamb will not fit to Jesus because Jesus open his mouth when he is on the cross, lets read in Matthew 27:46:

> Matthew 27:46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

In this passage, clearly Jesus was asking God why he was forsaken even though he already know that he was to be killed. Clearly Isaiah 53:7 is not Jesus.


## In Isaiah 53:10
> Isaiah 53:10 - Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.

Isaiah 53:10 says that the servant will “see his seed,” meaning that after suffering, he will live to see his descendants. Jesus, however, had no wife or children, so this language cannot apply to him. The verse fits Israel far better, as the nation endured suffering yet continued through its offspring.
