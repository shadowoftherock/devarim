Addressing **Zechariah 13:8–9** as referring to **“the whole land”**—not a symbolic church—together with the **textual evidence from the Old Testament itself**.

## **Continuation (Old Testament Only)**

**Zechariah 13:8–9**

> *“And it shall come to pass in all the land, saith the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.
> And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried…”*

# **THE TEXT SAYS “THE WHOLE LAND”—AND THE OLD TESTAMENT CONFIRMS IT**

Many have attempted to spiritualize this passage, claiming it refers to a “church.”
But the **Old Testament itself** leaves no room for that interpretation.
Zechariah is speaking of **the literal land of Israel**, the land promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

## **1. The Hebrew Phrase is Geographic: “אֶרֶץ” – ERETZ (Land)**

The word used in Zech. 13:8 is **אֶרֶץ (eretz)**
→ the same word used throughout the OT to refer to the **literal land of Israel**, not a spiritual assembly.

Examples:

### **• Zechariah 12:1**

> “…the LORD, which stretcheth forth the heavens… and formeth the spirit of man within him.”

This chapter continues directly into chapter 13—same context.

### **• Zechariah 12:2, 5–7**

Jerusalem, Judah, and *the inhabitants of Jerusalem* are literal, not symbolic.

### **• Zechariah 13:1**

> “…a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem…”
> Again, **literal Israel.**

The entire section from Zechariah 12–14 is about **Judah, Jerusalem, and the land**, not about the church.

This is the **first proof**.

---

## **2. Zechariah 14 Continues the Same Geographic Context**

There is no chapter break in the original scroll. Chapter 14 is still the same prophecy:

### **Zechariah 14:1–2**

> “For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle… and half of the city shall go forth into captivity.”

**Jerusalem**, **the mount of Olives**, **Judah**—these are not metaphors for a church.

Zechariah 13 must be understood in its context:
the **nation** and **geographic land** of Israel.

## **3. The Refining Process Is Applied to Israel, Not a Church**

### **Isaiah 48:10**

> “I have refined thee… in the furnace of affliction.”

God speaks this to **literal Israel**.

### **Malachi 3:2–3**

> “He shall sit as a refiner… and purify the sons of Levi.”
> Levi is a literal tribe in a literal land.

The refining fire is God’s national purification of **Israel**, not a metaphor for a church.

---

# **Conclusion**

**Zechariah 13:8–9** speaks of:

* **The literal land** of Israel
* **The literal people** of Israel
* **A literal national judgment and purification**
* **A literal remnant that will survive and call upon the LORD**
* **It has nothing to do with a church.**
