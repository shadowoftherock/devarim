## Can Noahides use birth control?

The Noahide laws do not prohibit contraception. The prohibition of "forbidden relations" focuses on specific types of sexual relationships (such as adultery, incest, homosexuality, and bestiality), not on contraception within permitted relationships.

The prohibition includes "precepts related to spilling semen and contraception," which suggests there are *some* guidelines around contraception, but it's not completely forbidden.

Key points:

**What's generally understood:**
- Unlike the obligation that applies to Jewish men, Noahide law does not obligate women to procreate in the same way
- The prohibition primarily concerns "wasting seed" in a way that's disconnected from marital relations
- Contraception within marriage is generally considered acceptable, especially when there are valid reasons (health, spacing children, family planning)

**Important considerations:**
- Methods that prevent conception (like birth control pills, IUDs) are generally more acceptable than those that might destroy an already-fertilized embryo
- It's best to consult with a qualified Noahide rabbi or authority for specific guidance on particular methods
- Both spouses should ideally agree on the use of contraception

The approach to contraception for Noahides is generally more lenient than the restrictions that apply to Jews under Jewish law.

## What is prohibited?


Coitus interruptus, commonly known as the withdrawal method or "pulling out," is a form of birth control where the penis is withdrawn from the vagina before ejaculation occurs. This practice is prohibiited in both Jewish law and Noahide law.

## Why is it prohibited?

There's a biblical commandment to "be fruitful and multiply" (Genesis 1:28). Traditional Jewish law (halakha) generally prohibits wasting seed (hashchatat zera), which is interpreted to forbid ejaculation outside the context where conception is possible. Coitus interruptus is specifically mentioned in the Torah in the story of Onan (Genesis 38:8-10), who was punished for "spilling his seed on the ground" to avoid fulfilling his duty to provide offspring for his deceased brother's widow.


HaShem's command to Noah: After the flood, HaShem blessed Noah and his sons and said to them: "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth" (Genesis 9:1). This command is later repeated in Genesis 9:7.
