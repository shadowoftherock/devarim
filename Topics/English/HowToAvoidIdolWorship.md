## What is idol worshiping?

Under the **Noahide laws**—the seven universal laws given in Jewish tradition for all humanity—**idol worship** is strictly prohibited. Here’s a clear breakdown:

---

### 1. **Definition of Idol Worship (Avodah Zarah)**

In the Noahide framework, idol worship means:

* **Believing that a created object or being has divine power**.
* **Praying, sacrificing, or performing religious rituals to something other than HaShem**.
* **Using images, statues, or natural objects as intermediaries to HaShem** in a way that attributes them independent authority.

**Examples:**

* Praying to statues, paintings, or icons as if they were God.
* Burning incense, making offerings, or bowing to anything created that you treat as divine.
* Believing that certain objects have powers to bless, curse, or influence events independently of HaShem.

### 2. **Noahide Prohibition**

The **second of the seven Noahide laws** is commonly phrased as:

> “Do not worship idols.”

This law applies to all humanity and forbids:

* **All forms of polytheism** (worshiping multiple gods).
* **All idolatry** (treating any created object as god).
* **Participating in rituals or customs that honor created things as divine**.

The reasoning is that HaShem is **one, eternal, and incorporeal**, so no human-made object can represent or replace Him.

### 3. **Practical Implications for Noahides**

To follow this law:

* Pray only to HaShem, not to statues, icons, or images.
* Do not make offerings, sacrifices, or rituals to anything but HaShem.
* Avoid objects or images intended for religious worship or divine invocation.
* Teach children and others to recognize HaShem as the sole source of power and blessing.

## How not to worship idols?

1. **Focus on the Divine, Not Objects**

   * Direct your prayers, gratitude, and devotion toward HaShem, not any physical representation.

2. **Avoid Rituals That Give Power to Idols**

   * Do not bow, make offerings, or perform acts that treat objects as having divine authority.

3. **Avoid Creating or Displaying Graven Images for Worship**

   * Do not carve, paint, or possess images or statues intended for divine worship.
   * Refrain from placing objects in your home or personal space as a “focus of prayer” or for blessings.
   * If images are used for educational or decorative purposes, keep them clearly separate from devotional acts.

4. **Engage in HaShem-Centered Practices**

   * Pray, meditate, study scriptures, and perform acts of kindness that honor HaShem directly.

5. **Avoid Superstitions Linked to Objects**

   * Do not attribute luck, misfortune, or blessings to touching or venerating objects.

6. **Be Mindful in Daily Life**

   * Avoid saying “thank you” to images, making vows to objects, or giving offerings to created forms.

7. **Seek Guidance from Your Faith Community**

   * Follow teachings from your scriptures or religious leaders on avoiding idol worship.
