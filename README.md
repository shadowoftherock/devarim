Studying the ways of God of truth

Isaiah 65:17
17 “For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth, and the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind.

- What does the verse means? does he mean a literal new heavens and a new earth like he will destroy the former or he will create a new chapter of within the old heaven and old earth?
