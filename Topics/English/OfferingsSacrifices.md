## Why the Israelites stopped offering burnt offerings

**The Israelites stopped offering burnt offerings because the Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed**, and according to the Torah, sacrifices could only be offered at the Temple.

---

## Step-by-step explanation

### 1. Burnt offerings required the Temple

In the Torah (especially Leviticus), burnt offerings (*ʿolah*) had strict rules:

* They could only be offered **at the altar**
* The altar had to be **at the chosen place** (eventually Jerusalem)
* Only **priests (kohanim)** could perform them

Once the Temple was gone, sacrifices were no longer possible.

---

### 2. Destruction of the First Temple (586 BCE)

* The Babylonians destroyed Solomon’s Temple
* Sacrifices **temporarily stopped**
* During the exile, Israelites turned more to **prayer, repentance, and Torah**

---

### 3. Second Temple period (516 BCE–70 CE)

* The Temple was rebuilt
* Burnt offerings resumed and continued for centuries

---

### 4. Final stop: Destruction of the Second Temple (70 CE)

* The Romans destroyed the Second Temple
* **Sacrificial worship permanently ceased**
* Judaism could no longer practice offerings without violating the Law

This is the decisive moment when burnt offerings truly ended.

---

### 5. What replaced sacrifices?

Rabbinic Judaism taught that HaShem accepts:

* **Prayer** (e.g., daily prayers replacing daily offerings)
* **Torah study**
* **Good deeds (charity, justice, mercy)**
* **Repentance**

This idea is rooted in Scripture:

* *“We will offer the fruit of our lips instead of bulls”* (Hosea 14:2)
* *“To obey is better than sacrifice”* (1 Samuel 15:22)

---

### 6. Do Jews expect sacrifices to return?

* **Traditional Judaism**: Some believe sacrifices will return if the Temple is rebuilt
* **Others**: Believe prayer has permanently replaced sacrifices

---

### Summary

The Israelites did **not abandon burnt offerings by choice**.
They stopped because:

1. The Temple was destroyed
2. Sacrifices were forbidden outside the Temple
3. Judaism adapted to survive without it











## Why the receivers of noahide laws are not obliged to offer sacrifices on their own?

The answer comes from **how the Noahide laws are defined in the Bible and later Jewish tradition**, and from **who sacrifices are actually commanded to**.

---

## Short answer

**The Noahide laws never command sacrifices**, so those who are bound only by the Noahide laws (non-Jews) are **not obligated** to offer them.

---

## Step-by-step explanation

### 1. Sacrifices are part of the Sinai covenant, not the Noahide covenant

There are **two different covenantal systems** in the Hebrew Bible:

### 🔹 Noahide covenant (Genesis 8–9)

* Given to **all humanity**
* Includes basic moral and social laws (the 7 Noahide laws)
* **No sacrificial system is commanded**
* Purpose: preserve life, justice, and order among nations

### 🔹 Sinai covenant (Exodus–Leviticus)

* Given **only to Israel**
* Includes:

  * Temple
  * Priesthood
  * Detailed sacrificial laws
* Sacrifices are a **sign of Israel’s unique service**

Because sacrifices belong to the Sinai covenant, **only Israel is commanded to perform them**.

---

### 2. Obligation requires a command

In Jewish law:

> **You are obligated only to what you are commanded to do.**

Since the Noahide laws:

* Do **not** include sacrifices
* Do **not** require a Temple, altar, or priests

There is **no obligation** for Noahides to offer sacrifices.

---

### 3. Sacrifices require priesthood and altar

Burnt offerings require:

* A consecrated altar
* Aaronic priests
* A sanctified place chosen by HaShem

None of these exist in the Noahide framework, so obligation would be impossible.

---

### 4. Biblical precedent: righteous non-Israelites

Before Sinai:

* **Noah** offered a sacrifice (voluntary, not commanded)
* **Job** offered sacrifices for his family
* **Jethro** offered sacrifices after joining Israel

These acts were:

* **Permitted**
* **Voluntary**
* **Not required**

This sets the pattern: non-Israelites may offer sacrifices, but are **not commanded** to do so.

---

### 5. Post-Temple reality

Even Israelites are currently **not obligated** to offer sacrifices because:

* There is no Temple
* Offering them elsewhere is forbidden

If Israel itself is exempt due to circumstance, Noahides certainly are.

---

### 6. Rabbinic summary

Rabbinic Judaism teaches:

* Noahides serve HaShem through **ethical monotheism**
* Israel serves HaShem through **commanded ritual**
* Both paths are valid and intended by HaShem

---

## Summary

Noahide law receivers are not obliged to offer sacrifices because:

1. Their covenant does **not include** sacrificial commands
2. Sacrifices belong to Israel’s Sinai covenant
3. Obligation only follows explicit command
4. Non-Israelite sacrifices are **voluntary, not required**




## If the Temple is rebuilt, are we allowed to participate in offering sacrifices?

According to classical Jewish sources, Noahides (non-Jews) *may* participate in offering sacrifices if the Temple is rebuilt, but they are *not obligated*, and there are limits.**

---

## Detailed explanation

### 1. The Torah explicitly allows non-Israelite sacrifices

The clearest source is:

> **“For My House shall be called a house of prayer for *all peoples*.”**
> — Isaiah 56:7

The Temple was not meant only for Israel; it had a universal dimension.

---

### 2. Foreigners offered sacrifices in the Temple

The Torah and later Jewish tradition recognize offerings from non-Israelites:

* **Leviticus 22:18** — speaks of “anyone of the house of Israel *or of the strangers in Israel*” who brings an offering
* **Numbers 15:14–16** — “One law shall be for you and for the stranger”
* **1 Kings 8:41–43** — Solomon prays that HaShem will accept prayers of foreigners who come to the Temple

The Mishnah and Talmud (e.g., **Zevachim 116b**) affirm that **gentiles may bring offerings**.

---

### 3. What kind of sacrifices may Noahides bring?

According to halakhic sources:

### ✅ Permitted

* **Burnt offerings (*ʿolah*)** — completely consumed on the altar
* **Voluntary offerings** brought through the priests

### ❌ Not permitted

* **Sin offerings** (*ḥaṭṭat*) or **guilt offerings** (*asham*)

  * These are tied to specific Torah commandments that apply only to Israel
* **Offerings requiring ritual purity laws** unique to Jews

So participation is **limited but real**.

---

### 4. Who performs the sacrifice?

Even if a Noahide brings an offering:

* The **priests (kohanim)** perform the actual sacrificial service
* The Noahide does **not** act as a priest or perform altar rituals

---

### 5. Are Noahides obligated if the Temple is rebuilt?

**No.**

* Obligation applies only to Israel
* Noahides remain bound only by the 7 Noahide laws
* Sacrifices remain **optional acts of devotion**

---

### 6. Theological meaning

Judaism sees:

* **Israel** as a *priestly nation* with ritual obligations
* **The nations** as worshippers of HaShem through righteousness and justice

The Temple allows **both roles** to coexist.

---

## Summary

If the Temple is rebuilt:

* ✅ Noahides **may bring voluntary sacrifices**
* ❌ They are **not required** to do so
* ❌ They may not bring sin/guilt offerings
* ✅ Sacrifices are offered **through Jewish priests**
* ✅ This fits the Temple’s role as a house for all nations
