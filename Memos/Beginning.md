Beloved brothers and sisters,
friends and fellow servants of the Most High,

Today we stand at the beginning of something sacred.
We gather not in the strength of our own hands,
nor in the wisdom of our own hearts,
but under the name of **the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob**—
the One who revealed Himself to Israel,
the One who keeps covenant and mercy to a thousand generations.

From the days when God called Abraham out of Ur,
saying *“Walk before Me and be thou perfect,”*
the Almighty has always searched for those
who would set themselves apart,
who would choose His ways above the ways of men,
who would hear His voice and follow Him with an undivided heart.

Today, we declare that **we choose that path.**

This new group—this fellowship of servants—
is born not out of human ambition,
but out of a desire to return to the ancient paths
where the good way is,
and to walk therein.

We stand here because we believe, as Joshua said to Israel:

> *“As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.”*

We believe the words spoken through Moses:

> *“Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is One.”*

We believe that the God who parted the sea,
who spoke from the mountain,
who guided Israel by cloud and fire,
is still the living God today.

And so we gather to form a people
who honor His commandments,
who seek His truth,
who bless Israel as He commanded Abraham, saying:

> *“I will bless them that bless thee.”*

Our purpose is simple—but holy:

* To learn the ways of the LORD from the Scriptures.
* To walk in righteousness and justice.
* To encourage one another in obedience and faithfulness.
* To stand as witnesses that the God of the patriarchs
  is still worthy to be served with all our heart, soul, and strength.

May this group become a light in dark places,
a remnant devoted to the covenant,
a people who fear God and keep His commandments.

As Solomon prayed:

> *“Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God.”*

Let this be our banner.
Let this be our identity.
Let this be our commitment today and for all the days to come.
May the God of truth establish this work of our hands.

And as we begin this brotherhood,
may His presence go before us,
may His wisdom guide us,
and may His blessing rest upon all who seek Him in truth.

**Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,
from everlasting to everlasting.**

Amen.
