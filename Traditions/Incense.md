Blessed are You, HaShem,
God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
King of the universe,
who formed the heavens and the earth by Your word
and appointed times of holiness before You.

May this offering of incense rise before You
as a pleasing fragrance,
as the prayers of Your servants ascend
from a sincere and humble heart.
Not by fire alone, but by repentance, gratitude,
and awe of Your Name.

Purify our thoughts,
sanctify our words, 
and draw us nearer to Your presence,
for You are holy and Your Name is holy.

Remember us for mercy, O HaShem,
accept our service not by our merit
but by Your great compassion.
Let peace, wisdom, and righteousness
flow upon us and upon all Your creation.

Blessed are You, HaShem,
who receives prayer
and delights in the offering of a faithful heart.
