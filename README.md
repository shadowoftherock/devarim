Studying the ways of God of truth

Isaiah 65:17
17 “For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth, and the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind.

- How should this verse be understood? Is it teaching that God will completely destroy the present heavens and earth and create new ones? Or is it speaking of a renewed era brought forth within the existing creation?
