Talmud does discuss prohibitions related to food offered to idols, though the details are complex and the application depends on whether you're talking about Jews or non-Jews (Noahides).

**For Jews:**
The prohibition is called *yayin nesech* (wine used in idol worship) and *stam yeinam* (wine handled by idolaters), along with broader concerns about food connected to idolatry. The Talmud discusses this extensively in tractates like Avodah Zarah (literally "strange/foreign worship"). Jews are prohibited from deriving benefit from items actually used in idol worship.

**For Noahides:**
This is where it gets more nuanced. The seven Noahide laws include a prohibition against idolatry itself - meaning non-Jews shouldn't worship idols. However, there's debate among rabbinic authorities about whether Noahides are prohibited from eating food that was offered to idols by others.

Some authorities hold that if a non-Jew didn't personally engage in the idolatrous act, merely eating food that someone else offered to an idol wouldn't violate the Noahide prohibition against idolatry. Others take a stricter view.
