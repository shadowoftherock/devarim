## Kneeling in prayer. Here’s a clear way to do it:

### 1. **Choose a Quiet Space**

* Prayed facing Jerusalem. Pick a spot where you can focus.

### 2. **Kneeling Posture**

* **Knees together or slightly apart:** Comfortably on the floor or a prayer mat.
* **Shins on the ground:** You can sit back slightly on your heels if comfortable.
* **Feet position:** Toes pointing backward, tops of feet resting on the floor.

### 3. **Torso and Head**

* **Back straight but relaxed:** Avoid hunching.
* **Head bowed slightly:** Shows humility.
* **Hands:** Can rest on your thighs, knees, or fold together in front of you.

### 4. **Heart and Mind**

* Focus on prayer, gratitude, and humility.

## How to Pray Standing

1. **Feet Position**

   * Stand with feet together, grounded, and balanced.
   * Some traditions suggest placing one foot slightly forward for focus and stability.

2. **Body Posture**

   * Keep your back straight.
   * Head slightly bowed in humility.

3. **Hand Position**

   * Common: hands at your sides or clasped gently in front.
   * During certain prayers (like the Amidah), some Jews sway slightly back and forth (**shuckling**) to focus and internalize words.

4. **Focus and Intent**

   * Prayer isn’t just posture—your heart and mind should be fully engaged.
