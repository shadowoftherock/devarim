# Alternative for marriage contract
In view of the absence of divorce under the marriage contract, the parties have elected to enter into an alternative legal agreement.


## Philippines settings

To create a legally binding contract for a couple in the Philippines outside of a formal marriage**, but there are important limitations: Philippine law does **not** treat such contracts as equivalent to marriage, and they do **not** automatically give you the full set of rights that married couples have (like inheritance rights, spousal status under family law, etc.). ([LawShun][1])

Here’s how it works and what *types* of agreements are possible:

---

## ✅ 1. **Cohabitation/Live-in Partnership Agreement (Contract)**

Under Philippine law, unmarried couples (opposite-sex or same-sex) may enter into a **private contract** spelling out their rights and obligations as partners — often called a *cohabitation agreement* or *domestic partnership declaration*. ([Respicio & Co.][2])

**What it can cover:**

* Division and ownership of shared property acquired during the relationship
* How expenses and finances are shared
* Agreements on living arrangements or responsibilities
* Terms for separation (if you choose one)
* Support obligations (where lawful)

**Legal basis:**

* The *Civil Code* allows parties to contract freely as long as the agreement:

  * Has mutual consent,
  * Deals with lawful objectives,
  * Has a valid cause,
  * Does not violate public policy or morals. ([Respicio & Co.][2])

**Important details:**

* **It doesn’t create a marriage-equivalent status.** Philippine law does *not* recognize “common-law marriage” or domestic partnership as a legal family status the same way marriage is recognized. ([LawShun][1])
* A written and **notarized contract** is strongly recommended so it’s easier to enforce in court if disputes arise.
* You can also prepare a **separation agreement** now that sets terms for how things are handled if the relationship ends. ([Genie AI][3])

## ✅ 2. **Declaration of Domestic Partnership**

This is a kind of *formal statement* that a couple is in a committed relationship. It doesn’t automatically create legal status, but it can help in practical situations:

* Company benefits (employer recognitions)
* Hospital visitation or designation of health decision-maker
* Support for immigration or documentation purposes (e.g., insurance, residency proofs)

Some cities (like Quezon City and San Juan) issue local cards/certificates recognizing domestic partnerships — but at the **national level** these do **not** make you “spouses” under the law. ([Wikipedia][4])

---

## ❌ 3. **It Is *Not* a Substitute for Marriage**

Because Philippine law sees **marriage as a unique legal institution**, any personal “vow” or contract will not:

* Automatically create spousal rights (inheritance, spousal support under Family Code)
* Automatically recognize your relationship in legal contexts where marriage is required (e.g., certain tax benefits, spousal privileges, next-of-kin rights)

Only a marriage **under Philippine law** creates that status. ([RESPICIO & CO.][5])

---

## 🏛️ 4. **Civil Partnership / Proposed Laws**

There are **proposed bills** in the Philippine Congress to recognize civil partnerships or civil solidarity pacts (similar to what other countries have), which if passed would give legal status to couples outside marriage — but **as of now they’re not yet law.** ([Inquirer.net][6])

## 📝 Practical Steps You Could Take

If you want a *law-binding vow/contract for your relationship without marrying*, you can consider:

1. **Draft a Cohabitation/Partnership Agreement**

   * Spell out property, financial, support, and other terms
   * Have it **written and notarized**

2. **Add a Separation Agreement Clause**

   * This pre-agrees how you’ll resolve things if you separate later

3. **Include Practical Powers**

   * Special Power of Attorney for health decisions, etc.

4. **Consult a Lawyer**

   * A local Filipino family law attorney can tailor your contract based on your needs and make sure it’s enforceable.
