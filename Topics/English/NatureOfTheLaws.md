**The Ten Commandments are primarily *preventive* and *principle-based*, not exhaustive legal codes.**
They state **moral boundaries**, not detailed case law.

## What the Ten Commandments *are*

In Jewish and classical Christian understanding, the Ten Commandments (עֲשֶׂרֶת הַדִּבְּרוֹת, *Aseret ha-Dibrot*) are:

* **Foundational moral principles**
* **Covenantal obligations**
* **Broad prohibitions and duties**
* **Root categories** from which detailed laws flow

They are not meant to list every allowed or forbidden action.

---

## Are they preventive by nature?

**Yes—very much so.**
They function like **guardrails**, not technical statutes.

### Example: “You shall not murder” (לא תרצח – *lo tirtsach*)

This commandment:

* Prohibits **intentional, unlawful killing**
* Does **not** attempt to define all forms of violence

In Jewish law:

* **Injury** is covered elsewhere (Exodus 21:18–19, 21:24–25)
* **Accidental killing** is treated differently (Numbers 35)
* **Self-defense** is permitted
* **Capital punishment** (in theory) is not murder

So your instinct is right:

> *The commandment sets the outer moral limit; other laws handle degrees of harm.*

## Why the commandments are phrased absolutely

The Torah assumes:

* A moral society needs **clear red lines**
* Details belong in **case law**, not in the charter itself

Think of them as:

* **Constitutional principles**, not penal code sections

---

## Another example: “You shall not steal” (לא תגנב)

* The commandment itself is brief and absolute
* Detailed laws later explain:

  * Theft vs. fraud
  * Restitution
  * Kidnapping (which some Jewish sources say is the primary meaning here)

---

## Preventive logic (how it works)

The commandments aim to:

1. **Stop the act**
2. **Restrain the impulse**
3. **Shape character**
4. **Protect community stability**

That’s why later traditions expand them inward:

* Judaism → safeguards (*fences around the Torah*)
* Christianity → inner intention (e.g., anger, lust)
* Both see the commandments as **ethical roots**, not technical loopholes

---

## Your example: injury vs killing

Your formulation fits well with classical interpretation:

* ❌ Murder → absolutely forbidden
* ⚠️ Injury → regulated, compensated, punished proportionally
* ✅ Self-defense → allowed
* ⚖️ Accidental harm → different category

The commandment is **not saying “anything short of death is fine.”**
It’s saying: *human life is inviolable*, and everything else is measured in relation to that value.

## Summary

* The Ten Commandments are **preventive, principled, and foundational**
* They set **moral boundaries**, not full legal definitions
* Detailed laws elsewhere explain **degrees, exceptions, and remedies**
* Your intuition matches **Jewish and classical legal reasoning**
