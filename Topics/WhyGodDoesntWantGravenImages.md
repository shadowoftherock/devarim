## God forbids graven images:

---

God’s Word is very clear: He desires a relationship with His people that is pure and untainted by idols. From the very beginning, He commanded His people not to make images to worship. In **Exodus 20:4-5**, He declares:

> “You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them…”

This command was not optional. God did not tolerate worship of physical representations because He is Spirit, and His presence cannot be confined to wood, stone, or metal.

In **Leviticus 19:4**, God warns further:

> “Do not turn to idols or make for yourselves molten gods: I am the Lord your God.”

Even the nation of Israel, chosen to be His holy people, was frequently rebuked for creating graven images:

* **Deuteronomy 27:15** – “Cursed is the one who makes a carved or cast metal image, an abomination to the Lord, a thing made by the hands of a craftsman, and sets it up in secret.”
* **Isaiah 42:8** – “I am the Lord; that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my praise to carved idols.”
* **Jeremiah 10:3-5** – The prophet warns how the nations make idols of wood and decorate them with silver and gold, yet these cannot speak or save.

God’s instruction is consistent: He alone is to be worshiped, and no man-made object can take His place. Anything else is a diversion from His glory. As His people, we are called to keep our hearts devoted to Him alone, not to images of stone, metal, or even religious symbols made by human hands.

Time and again, the history of Israel shows us the consequences of turning to idols. God’s people were repeatedly warned, yet they often disobeyed. Consider these examples:

* **Exodus 32:1-8** – While Moses was on Mount Sinai receiving the Law, the people grew impatient and made a golden calf to worship. God’s anger burned, and Moses interceded to spare them, but the severity of idolatry was made clear: turning to a graven image provokes the Lord.

* **Judges 17:3-6** – Micah made an idol and set up a shrine in his house, even appointing one of his sons as priest. The text says, *“In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.”* This shows that without God’s law guiding them, people default to idolatry—a direct violation of His commandments.

* **1 Kings 12:28-30** – King Jeroboam, fearing his people would go to Jerusalem, set up golden calves in Bethel and Dan for worship. God’s Word later records the result: these acts led the nation into sin, illustrating that idols are not only worthless but spiritually destructive.

* **Psalm 115:4-8** – The psalmist makes it clear: *“Their idols are silver and gold, the work of human hands. They have mouths, but do not speak; eyes, but do not see; ears, but do not hear; noses, but do not smell; hands, but do not feel; feet, but do not walk; and they do not make a sound in their throat. Those who make them become like them; so do all who trust in them.”*

Notice the pattern: God calls His people to trust Him, not objects crafted by human hands. Idols cannot speak, save, or guide. To turn to them is to turn away from the living God.

* **Isaiah 44:9-20** – The prophet mocks the folly of idol-makers: they use part of the tree to burn for warmth and the rest to carve an idol, then bow to it and worship. This shows the absurdity and futility of graven images—they are powerless and made by human hands, yet people give them honor that belongs only to God.

Brothers and sisters, the lesson is clear: the Lord alone deserves our worship. Anything made by man, no matter how revered or ornate, is a hollow substitute. God’s heart is for us to worship Him in truth, not in imitation or image.
