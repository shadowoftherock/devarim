## Why do we need to recognize Israel as part of honoring HaShem ?

When we speak of following HaShem and honoring His people Israel, we are not inventing a command of our own. We stand on the foundation of HaShem’s ancient covenant—spoken by His own mouth, recorded by His prophets, and preserved in His Word.

### **1. HaShem Called Abraham and Set Him Apart**

When HaShem first called Abram in Genesis 12, He did not simply give him a private blessing—He gave him a **mission** and formed a **covenant** that would shape nations:

> **“I will make of thee a great nation… and thou shalt be a blessing… and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.”**
> — *Genesis 12:2–3*

And embedded in that promise is a principle for all generations:

> **“I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee.”**
> — *Genesis 12:3*

To bless the descendants of Abraham is not about politics, nations, or human preferences. It is aligning ourselves with HaShem’s declared will.

### **2. HaShem Reaffirmed His Covenant Over and Over**

The covenant was not a one-time moment. HaShem confirmed it again:

* **To Abraham:**
  *“I will establish my covenant… for an everlasting covenant.”* (Gen. 17:7)

* **To Isaac:**
  *“I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father.”* (Gen. 26:3)

* **To Jacob:**
  *“The land… I will give it to thee, and to thy seed after thee.”* (Gen. 28:13)

Notice the pattern:
**HaShem Himself guards the covenant. HaShem Himself watches over Abraham’s seed.**

This is why following HaShem includes respecting His chosen purpose for Israel.

### **3. HaShem Commands His People to Walk in His Ways**

When Israel became a nation, Hashem made clear:

> **“Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people.”**
> — *Exodus 19:5*

Following HaShem is not merely believing in His existence—it is obeying His voice.
And His voice has spoken concerning Israel, His chosen people:

> **“For Hashem’s portion is His people; Jacob is the lot of His inheritance.”**
> — *Deuteronomy 32:9*

If HaShem treasures them, how can we despise what He treasures?

### **4. Blessing Israel Is Part of Fearing HaShem**

The Psalms give us insight:

> **“Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.”**
> — *Psalm 122:6*

This is not about favoritism. This is about **alignment** with HaShem’s heart and HaShem’s promises.

When we bless what HaShem blesses—He blesses us.
When we honor what HaShem honors—He honors us.

### **5. HaShem’s Faithfulness Is the Pattern for Our Obedience**

All through the Old Testament, HaShem shows that **He keeps His promises**, even when His people fail. If HaShem is faithful to His covenant, then those who fear Him should also respect that covenant.

Jeremiah writes:

> **“Thus saith Hashem; If my covenant be not with day and night… then may also my covenant with David my servant be broken.”**
> — *Jeremiah 33:25–26*

HaShem ties His faithfulness to creation itself.
So when we follow HaShem, we stand with Him in what He upholds.

## **Conclusion of the Sermon**

We follow HaShem because He is the Creator, the Lawgiver, the One who brought Israel out of Egypt, gave His covenant to Abraham, and rules over all the nations.

And we bless Israel not because they are perfect, but because **HaShem chose them**, HaShem made promises to them, and HaShem blesses those who bless them.

To follow HaShem is to honor His word.
To honor His word is to honor His covenant.
And His covenant begins with Abraham and his descendants.

---


## ** CONTINUES**

We have seen that HaShem’s call to bless the descendants of Abraham is woven deeply into the covenant. But let us go further, and see how HaShem Himself responds to nations and individuals according to how they treat His people.

### **6. HaShem Judges Nations Based on Their Treatment of Israel**

In the book of the prophet Zechariah, Hashem gives a warning to all nations:

> **“For he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of His eye.”**
> — *Zechariah 2:8*

This is not poetry—it is divine reality.
To touch Israel with harm is to poke your finger into HaShem’s own eye.
To bless them is to honor His heart.

Later, Hashem declares:

> **“I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.”**
> — *Zechariah 12:9*

This is why following HaShem includes taking His side.
No nation that fights against HaShem’s purpose can stand.
No people that bless His chosen will go unnoticed.

### **7. The Covenant Extends to Generations**

HaShem told Abraham plainly:

> **“My covenant will I establish… for an everlasting covenant to be a HaShem unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.”**
> — *Genesis 17:7*

*Everlasting* means it does not expire.

Even when Israel sinned, HaShem never erased His promise:

> **“Yet for all that… I will not cast them away… to break my covenant with them.”**
> — *Leviticus 26:44–45*

His covenant becomes the model for us:
If HaShem remains faithful, then those who follow Him should honor what He honors.

### **8. Following HaShem Means Walking in His Commands**

Hashem commanded Israel:

> **“Hear, O Israel… thou shalt love Hashem thy HaShem with all thine heart.”**
> — *Deuteronomy 6:4–5*

But He also commanded the nations around Israel to respect His chosen people.
Through Balaam, HaShem spoke a truth that no sorcerer or king could undo:

> **“Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.”**
> — *Numbers 24:9*

HaShem does not change His mind.
The principle remains.

### **9. HaShem Uses Israel as a Living Testimony to the Nations**

Israel is not just a people—Israel is a message.

Hashem said to them:

> **“Ye are My witnesses, saith Hashem.”**
> — *Isaiah 43:10*

> ... I will faithfully give them their recompense, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them. Their offspring shall be known among the nations, and their descendants in the midst of the peoples; all who see them shall acknowledge them, that they are an offspring Hashem has blessed.
> — *Isaiah 61:8-9*


Through Israel:

* His power was shown in Egypt
* His holiness was shown in the Law
* His faithfulness was shown in the covenant
* His mercy was shown in their restoration
* His justice was shown in their discipline

To bless Israel is to bless HaShem’s testimony on earth.

# **If Israel had sinned, why do we still recognize them?**


If we are to understand HaShem’s heart toward Israel, we must listen carefully to the prophet Jeremiah. Jeremiah lived in a time of judgment—Jerusalem fell, the temple burned, the people were exiled. Yet in the midst of judgment, HaShem revealed something deeper:
**His mercy is stronger than Israel’s failure.**

### **10. Israel’s Sin Was Great—But HaShem’s Mercy Was Greater**

Jeremiah boldly declares Israel’s unfaithfulness:

> **“My people have committed two evils;
> they have forsaken Me… and hewed them out broken cisterns.”**
> — *Jeremiah 2:13*

Israel forsook Hashem.
They worshiped idols.
They broke the covenant again and again.

Yet even then, HaShem’s heart was not to destroy but to restore.

### **11. HaShem Calls Israel to Return Because He Is Their Father**

Listen to His invitation:

> **“Return, ye backsliding children, saith Hashem;
> for I am married unto you.”**
> — *Jeremiah 3:14*

HaShem speaks like a husband calling back a wandering wife.
Like a Father reaching for a rebellious child.

Israel sinned deeply—but HaShem’s commitment remained deeper still.

### **12. HaShem Promises He Will Heal Their Rebellion**

Jeremiah presents one of the most tender promises in the Old Testament:

> **“Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings.”**
> — *Jeremiah 3:22*

HaShem does not say:
“I will consider forgiving you,”
nor
“I will watch you suffer for your sins.”

He says:
**“I will heal you.”**

Forgiveness is not merely HaShem overlooking sin—
It is HaShem restoring what sin broke.

### **13. HaShem Promises a Day of Full Cleansing**

Even after the exile, HaShem speaks through Jeremiah a promise of total forgiveness:

> **“For I will forgive their iniquity,
> and I will remember their sin no more.”**
> — *Jeremiah 31:34*

This is HaShem speaking about Israel.
The same Israel that broke the covenant.
The same Israel that was scattered.

Yet HaShem says:
**“I will remember their sin no more.”**

### **14. Israel’s Restoration Comes from HaShem’s Faithful Love**

Jeremiah tells us the deepest reason for Israel’s forgiveness:

> **“Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love:
> therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.”**
> — *Jeremiah 31:3*

Everlasting love.
Not temporary.
Not dependent on performance.
Not canceled by rebellion.

This is why HaShem forgives Israel:
**because His love is everlasting.**

### **15. HaShem Will Not Reject Israel, Even After Judgment**

Even when Israel was in Babylon, HaShem said through Jeremiah:

> **“I will not make a full end of thee.”**
> — *Jeremiah 46:28*

He disciplines—but He does not destroy.
He judges—but He does not abandon.

HaShem’s covenant stands even when Israel stumbles.

### **16. HaShem Promises to Restore Israel to Their Land**

Jeremiah records Hashem saying:

> **“I will bring again the captivity of My people Israel and Judah…
> and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers.”**
> — *Jeremiah 30:3*

Forgiveness is not only spiritual—it is national.
HaShem restores the land, the people, and the covenant blessings.

### **17. HaShem Turns Their Mourning Into Joy**

One of the most beautiful promises:

> **“I will turn their mourning into joy,
> and will comfort them… for I have mercy upon them.”**
> — *Jeremiah 31:13–14*

Israel may mourn for a season,
but HaShem has decreed that joy will come.

## **CONTINUES: HASHEM EVERLASTING MERCY TOWARD ISRAEL**

We have heard Jeremiah speak of HaShem’s unbreakable love and His promise to forgive Israel. But the message does not end there. HaShem expands this theme through the prophets, showing that His mercy toward Israel is not temporary—**it is woven into the very character of HaShem.**

### **18. HaShem’s Mercy Is Rooted in His Own Name**

Through Jeremiah, Hashem declares a powerful truth:

> **“For I am with thee, saith Hashem, to save thee…
> Though I make a full end of all nations… yet will I not make a full end of thee.”**
> — *Jeremiah 30:11*

HaShem ties Israel’s survival not to their obedience, but to **His own faithfulness**.
Nations rise and fall, kings come and go, but Israel endures because HaShem’s name is on them.

### **19. The Covenant Cannot Be Broken**

Still in Jeremiah, Hashem gives an illustration that is impossible for men to change:

> **“If ye can break My covenant of the day, and My covenant of the night…
> then may also My covenant with David My servant be broken.”**
> — *Jeremiah 33:20–21*

HaShem says:
“If you can stop the sun from rising or the moon from shining—then My covenant with Israel can fail.”

Who among men can do such a thing?
No one.

Therefore, His covenant stands.

### **20. HaShem Will Cleanse Israel and Restore Them**

Jeremiah records HaShem’s promise:

> **“I will cleanse them from all their iniquity… and I will pardon all their iniquities.”**
> — *Jeremiah 33:8*

Notice the repetition—“all… all…”
HaShem does not forgive partially.
He cleanses thoroughly.

And then He adds:

> **“It shall be to Me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations.”**
> — *Jeremiah 33:9*

Israel, once judged, becomes a testimony to HaShem’s mercy before every nation on earth.

### **21. Israel’s Restoration Is Certain and Physical**

HaShem does not forgive Israel only in spirit; He restores them **in the land**:

> **“Behold, I will gather them out of all countries…
> and I will bring them again unto this place.”**
> — *Jeremiah 32:37*

This is not symbolic.
This is not metaphorical.
This is HaShem returning His people to the land He swore to Abraham.

### **22. HaShem Promises to Plant Israel Permanently**

There is a promise rarely noticed, but it reveals the depth of HaShem’s commitment:

> **“I will plant them in this land assuredly with My whole heart and with My whole soul.”**
> — *Jeremiah 32:41*

HaShem Himself says He will plant them with:

* His whole heart
* His whole soul

What other nation has such a promise from the Creator?

### **23. HaShem Will Give Israel a Renewed Heart**

Jeremiah explains that Israel’s restoration includes an inner transformation:

> **“I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear Me for ever.”**
> — *Jeremiah 32:39*

Israel will not only return to the land;
they will return to Hashem with a renewed heart.

### **24. HaShem Turns Judgment Into Restoration**

Even the destruction of Jerusalem becomes a stage for HaShem’s mercy:

> **“Again there shall be heard… the voice of joy, and the voice of gladness.”**
> — *Jeremiah 33:10–11*

Where there was once sorrow,
HaShem decrees that joy will return.
Where there was ruin,
HaShem commands restoration.

## **The Message Becomes Clear**

Jeremiah teaches us that:

* HaShem forgives Israel
* HaShem restores Israel
* HaShem gathers Israel
* HaShem plants Israel
* HaShem transforms Israel
* HaShem protects Israel
* HaShem keeps His covenant with Israel forever

This is why we honor HaShem’s people:
Because their story does not reveal Israel’s goodness—
**it reveals HaShem’s goodness.**

It shows the world that:

* HaShem keeps His word
* HaShem does not abandon His promises
* HaShem’s mercy is stronger than human failure
* HaShem’s covenant stands through every generation

To bless Israel is to honor the HaShem who forgives them.
To follow HaShem is to respect what He has established.
