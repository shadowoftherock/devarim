## Hanukkah in 2025 begins **at sundown on Sunday, December 14, 2025**, and ends **at nightfall on Monday, December 22, 2025**.


Hanukkah comes from a dramatic moment in Jewish history — **a struggle for freedom, faith, and identity**.

Here is a clear and easy-to-follow explanation:

---

# ⭐ **Historical Background**

### 📌 When?

Around **164 BCE** (3598).

### 📌 Where?

The Land of Israel, mainly Jerusalem.

---

# ⚔️ Setting the Stage

The Jewish people were under the rule of the **Seleucid (Syrian-Greek) Empire**, led by **King Antiochus IV Epiphanes**.

He tried to:

* suppress Judaism
* force Hellenistic Greek culture
* outlaw Torah study, Sabbath, circumcision
* desecrate the Temple by placing idols there

This caused a crisis: Judaism itself was at risk of being erased.

---

# 🔥 The Revolt

A Jewish priestly family — the **Hasmoneans**, also known as the **Maccabees** — led a revolt.

Key figures:

* Mattathias
* His son Judah Maccabee (“Judah the Hammer”)

Against overwhelming odds, they:

✔ defeated the Greek armies
✔ reclaimed Jerusalem
✔ liberated the Temple

---

# ✨ The Rededication (Where the word Hanukkah comes from)

The Temple was cleansed and rededicated to HaShem.
**Hanukkah literally means “dedication.”**

They wanted to relight the **menorah**, but:

* only one jar of pure olive oil remained
* enough for *one* day of burning

---

# 🔥 The Miracle

According to Jewish tradition:

**The oil burned for eight days** — long enough to produce new pure oil.

This was seen as a sign of divine favor.

So Hanukkah lasts **eight nights** to recall that miracle.

---

# 🎉 How Hanukkah is Celebrated Today

* Lighting the menorah (hanukkiah)
* Reciting blessings
* Singing songs
* Eating foods fried in oil (latkes, donuts)
* Playing dreidel
* Giving charity and sometimes gift-giving

The focus is on:

* **religious freedom**
* **identity and resilience**
* **thankfulness for miracles**

---

# 📌 Summary in 3 lines

Hanukkah remembers:

1. The Jewish revolt against forced assimilation
2. The purification and rededication of the Temple
3. The miracle of oil lasting eight days

# Lighting Hanukkah candles follows a simple but meaningful order. Here’s a clear step-by-step guide:

---

# ⭐ **What You Need**

✔ A menorah (hanukkiah) with 9 branches
✔ Candles (one for each night + shamash/light helper candle)

---

# 📌 **Basic Rules**

### 🔥 1. The candles go **from right to left**

Each night, you add one new candle to the left side — meaning **the newest candle is always placed on the far left**.

Example:
Night 3 → you place 3 candles, latest one on the left.

---

### 🔥 2. You **light from left to right**

You light the **newest candle first**.

---

### 🔥 3. Use the “shamash” (helper) candle to light the others

This is the candle set apart (usually higher or lower than the rest).

---


# ✡️ **How to Light Hanukkah Candles (Step by Step)**

### **1. Place the candles**

* First night → 1 candle (far right)
* Second night → 2 candles (add one on the left)
* Third night → 3 candles, etc.

---

### **2. Light the shamash**

This one is lit first and used to light the rest.

---

### **3. Say the blessings**

**On the first night**:
You say **three blessings**:

1. Blessing over the candles
2. Blessing thanking HaShem for miracles
3. *Shehecheyanu* (thanking HaShem for reaching this occasion)

**On nights 2–8**:
You say **only the first two blessings**.

---

**Blessing 1 (for lighting the candles):**

*Baruch Atah Adonai Eloheinu Melech HaOlam, asher kid’shanu b’mitzvotav v’tzivanu l’hadlik ner shel Chanukah.*

*Blessed are You, Adonai Eloheinu, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to light the Hanukkah lights.*

**Blessing 2 (for the miracles):**

*Baruch Atah Adonai Eloheinu Melech HaOlam, she’asah nisim la’avoteinu, bayamim haheim bazman hazeh.*

*Blessed are You, Adonai Eloheinu, King of the universe, who performed miracles for our ancestors in those days, at this time.*

**First night only — Blessing 3 (Shehecheyanu):**

*Baruch Atah Adonai Eloheinu Melech HaOlam, shehecheyanu v’kiy’manu v’higianu lazman hazeh.*

*Blessed are You, Adonai Eloheinu, King of the universe, who has kept us alive, sustained us, and enabled us to reach this season*


---

### **4. Light the candles**

Using the shamash:

✔ Light the **newest candle first** (leftmost)
✔ Then light each one moving to the right.

---

### **5. Place the shamash back in its place**

---

### **6. Let the candles burn on their own**

Do not blow them out — they need to burn down (at least ~30 minutes).

---


# 📌 Where is the menorah placed?

Traditionally:

* In a doorway opposite the mezuzah or in a window facing the public
