From a **traditional Jewish perspective**, Jesus is not regarded as the Messiah because he did **not fulfill several core messianic expectations found in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh)**. Below is a respectful summary of the main points as Judaism understands them.

---

## 1. The Messiah Must Be a Human King from David’s Line (through the Father)

**Sources:** 2 Samuel 7:12–16; Jeremiah 23:5

* The Messiah must be a **biological descendant of King David through the paternal line**.
* In Jewish law, lineage is established through the **father**, not the mother.
* Jesus’ Davidic lineage is problematic in Judaism because:

  * The New Testament presents a **virgin birth**, meaning no biological father.
  * The genealogies in Matthew and Luke are inconsistent and traced through Joseph, who is not considered Jesus’ biological father.

**Jewish conclusion:** This requirement is not met.

---

## 2. The Messiah Must Rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem

**Sources:** Ezekiel 37:26–28; Isaiah 2:2–3

* The Messiah is expected to **rebuild the Third Temple**.
* Jesus did not rebuild the Temple.
* In fact, the Second Temple was destroyed in 70 CE after his death.

**Jewish conclusion:** This was not fulfilled.

---

## 3. The Messiah Must Gather All Jews Back to the Land of Israel

**Sources:** Isaiah 11:11–12; Deuteronomy 30:3–5

* A central messianic role is the **ingathering of all Jewish exiles** to Israel.
* During and after Jesus’ lifetime:

  * Jews remained scattered.
  * The exile intensified, not ended.

**Jewish conclusion:** This did not occur.

---

## 4. The Messiah Must Bring Universal Peace

**Sources:** Isaiah 2:4; Micah 4:3

* The messianic age is described as a time when:

  * Nations no longer wage war
  * Weapons are abandoned
* War, violence, and injustice clearly continued after Jesus’ life.

**Jewish conclusion:** The world did not enter the messianic age.

---

## 5. The Messiah Must Lead the World to Universal Knowledge of God

**Sources:** Isaiah 11:9; Zechariah 14:9

* The Messiah brings a time when **all humanity recognizes and worships the one God**.
* Judaism does not see later religious division or doctrinal conflict as fulfilling this vision.

**Jewish conclusion:** This condition remains unfulfilled.

---

## 6. The Messiah Must Uphold and Enforce the Torah

**Sources:** Deuteronomy 13; Isaiah 42:21

* The Messiah is expected to **fully observe and strengthen the Torah**, not change or replace it.
* Jewish tradition rejects any claim that:

  * The Torah is abolished
  * Divine law is superseded by faith alone

**Jewish conclusion:** Teachings attributed to Jesus are seen as conflicting with Torah permanence.

---

## Summary (Jewish View)

From a Jewish perspective, Jesus did **not** fulfill the biblical criteria for the Messiah because he did not:

* Reign as a Davidic king
* Rebuild the Temple
* Gather Jewish exiles
* Bring world peace
* Establish universal knowledge of God
* Fully uphold Torah law

Therefore, Judaism awaits a **future human Messiah** who will accomplish all these tasks.




# more verses

Below are **additional Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) prophecies** that **traditional Judaism** cites to define what the Messiah *must* accomplish—and which, from a Jewish perspective, remain **unfulfilled**. I’ll group them by theme and give short explanations.

---

## 1. Restoration of the Davidic Monarchy

### 📖 **Ezekiel 37:24–25**

> “My servant David shall be king over them… and they shall dwell in the land… forever.”

**Jewish understanding:**

* The Messiah is a **literal king**, ruling Israel politically and spiritually.
* Jesus never ruled as king of Israel.

---

### 📖 **Jeremiah 33:14–17**

> “David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel.”

* This prophecy speaks of **continuous, visible kingship**, not a spiritual or heavenly reign.

---

## 2. Rebuilding and Permanence of the Temple

### 📖 **Isaiah 2:2–3**

> “The mountain of the LORD’s house shall be established… and all nations shall flow unto it.”

* The Temple stands and functions as a global center of worship.
* This did not occur in Jesus’ lifetime.

---

### 📖 **Ezekiel 40–48**

* Nine full chapters describing:

  * Measurements
  * Priesthood
  * Sacrificial system
  * Festivals

**Jewish view:**

* These chapters are taken **literally**, indicating a future physical Temple.
* No metaphorical or “spiritual Temple” interpretation in classical Judaism.

---

### 📖 **Haggai 2:7–9**

> “The glory of this latter house shall be greater than the former.”

* Refers to a future Temple surpassing earlier ones in glory and peace.

---

## 3. Ingathering of All Jewish Exiles

### 📖 **Isaiah 11:11–12**

> “He shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.”

* A **global, total ingathering**, not partial or symbolic.

---

### 📖 **Jeremiah 23:7–8**

> “They shall no longer say… ‘who brought Israel out of Egypt,’ but… ‘who brought the children of Israel from all the lands.’”

* The redemption is **greater than the Exodus**—clearly historical and visible.

---

### 📖 **Ezekiel 36:24**

> “I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all countries, and bring you into your own land.”

---

## 4. Universal Peace and End of War

### 📖 **Isaiah 2:4**

> “Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.”

---

### 📖 **Micah 4:3–4**

> “They shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid.”

**Jewish understanding:**

* Peace is **global, political, and permanent**, not spiritualized.

---

## 5. Universal Knowledge of the One God (Monotheism)

### 📖 **Zechariah 14:9**

> “The LORD shall be King over all the earth; on that day the LORD shall be One and His name One.”

* No divisions, no competing theologies.

---

### 📖 **Isaiah 11:9**

> “The earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.”

* Not partial belief—**complete global awareness**.

---

### 📖 **Malachi 1:11**

> “My name shall be great among the nations… and in every place incense shall be offered to My name.”

* Worship of **one God**, not mediated through a human figure.

---

## 6. Worldwide Observance of Torah

### 📖 **Isaiah 42:21**

> “The LORD desires… to magnify the Torah and make it glorious.”

---

### 📖 **Isaiah 2:3**

> “For out of Zion shall go forth the Torah, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.”

* Torah observance increases; it is **not replaced**.

---

### 📖 **Malachi 3:22 (4:4 in Christian numbering)**

> “Remember the Torah of Moses, My servant… for all Israel.”

* The Torah remains binding in the messianic era.

---

## 7. Messiah Is Successful, Not Rejected or Killed

### 📖 **Isaiah 52:13**

> “My servant shall prosper, be exalted, and lifted up very high.”

**Jewish interpretation:**

* This passage continues into Isaiah 53, understood as **Israel as a nation**, not a failed or killed messiah.
