  > *(Daniel 6:10)*

* Acknowledging HaShem’s righteousness
* Asking for mercy—not because of Israel’s merit, but because of **HaShem’s compassion**

➡️ He prays as a **representative of the people**, not just for himself.

---

### 6. He prays **according to Scripture**

➡️ Scripture informs prayer.

---

* It accompanied **confession of sin**, not personal gain

This was:

* **Not total starvation**
* A fast from:

  * Meat
  * Wine
  * Rich foods
  * Comfort (oil/anointing)

➡️ A sustained **21-day fast** focused on prayer and mourning.

---
